<h5 class="sub-header">Tales of my Limited Creativity</h5>

<p>So, I'm still a bit behind on the Dev Academy material but I thought I'd take some time to post a blog post of my own.  Because it's Sunday and I don't feel like reading through the material at the moment.  Instead I feel like being a bit creative by blogging about my blog design.</p>
<p>After reviewing a bunch of other blogs, I have decided that I want to do something a bit different with mine.  After doodling in my notebook to design a wireframe doe my site, I had the reaslisation that my doodles didn't look half bad (I wouldn't say that they looked great either).  So I decided that I would make my blog look extremely similar to the wireframe doodle in my notebook.</p>
<p>After playing around with in for the last few days I have made a working design.  The hardest part was getting the margins and padding right so that the text would be positioned correctly over the background image.  I guess if that was the hardest part, then it's a pretty basic design - but I don't care.  It should stand out - for now.  I should probably rethink my design in the future if I am in a position where I want to be taken seriously as a coder - but future Luke can deal with that.</p>
<p>I have saved <a href="x1-blog-design/x1-blog-design.html" target="_blank">a copy of this page here</a> as a reference for what this page looked like when I started.  Hopefully if you're reading this in the future, my blog will look better (and not exactly the same).</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle I have to jump is getting the images right.  There were/are several problems with the one I am currently using.  Using some basic Paint skills I made all the notebook lines straight shifted the margin slightly so there would be more room.  I think it looks good now - as long as you don't look at it too closely (or you'll see that the image just ends on the right hand side).  I also need to decide what to do about the bottom of the image.  At the moment the words can come off the page.  I'm debating between having an infinitely long notebook and having to "turn the page".  I think I might go with the latter, although I'm not going to try attempt it now until I have settled on the image I want to use and learn enough Javascript that I know I can achieve it.</p>
<p>I also need to figure out how to turn some of my doodles into images with transparent backgrounds.</p>
