<h5 class="sub-header">Time Management (or lack of it)</h5>
<p>13:12 on 7 March 2017.</p>
<p>Okay, blog post number two.</p>
<p>For my next blog post I have been asked to write some reflections on some resources for time and habit management.  In truth, I have not had time to review these resources.  Yep, lot's of irony in this paragraph.
<p>In my last job, time management started to be an issue towards the end of my employment.  This was for a number of reasons - some of which are why I am here, at home on a Tuesday afternoon, enrolled in this bootcamp.  Therefore I know it is important that I review these resources.  However right now I am focusing my time on getting caught up in the material.  This blog post was part of a week 1 assignment and I am doing it in week 3.</p>
<p>I have bookmarked the resources in my browser.  I intend to get back to reviewing them at some point when I am caught up and no longer feel like I might be dragging the other participants back.  Do I believe myself when I say that I will get back to this later?  ...kind of?</p>
