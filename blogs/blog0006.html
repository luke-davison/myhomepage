<h5 class="sub-header">Not a Tale About How I Crashed My Car</h5>
<p>13:35 on 22 March 2017</p>
<p>Hello again, people of blog world.  For my next story, I am going to tell you the tale about the time I read one chapter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chade-Meng_Tan">Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan</a>.  If you are thinking that this tale sounds like it will be a bit uneventful, don't worry - you are correct.</p>
<p>I feel that the 'mindfulness' that the book teaches is something I can already do (to a certain degree).  I generally have good control over my emotions.  I was in my first traffic accident last week (the car I was in may be written off) and since then I haven't really felt any strong emotional response to the incident.  It will make some future events a bit difficult without the car but I'm not stressed about it.</p>
<p>That isn't to say I haven't much to learn.  My old job would stress me out occassionally and I had difficulty pinpointing exactly why.  I am also intrigued about one particular line from the chapter:</p>
<p><em>"That knowledge</em> [that you are starting to feel anger] <em>gives you the ability to respond in ways of your own choosing (such as leaving the room before you do something you know you will regret, or choosing to allow the anger to bloom if thatâ€™s the right response for the situation)."</em></p>
<p>It may seem strange but I'd like to know how to choose to allow my anger to bloom.  Several times I have thought, "I really should be getting angry at this".  If I can do that, it may come in handy when dealing with these Insurance companies.</p>
